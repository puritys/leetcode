Some examples:
"0" => true
" 0.1 " => true
"abc" => false
"1 a" => false
"2e10" => true

Note: It is intended for the problem statement to be ambiguous. You should gather all requirements up front before implementing one.

* Remove space at the start and the end of string
* Get the prefix letters from the string and only include the numbers and dot. If find a space inside the string then return false.
* If can not get any space at the end then return true.
